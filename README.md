# ft_containers

The aim of the project is to reimplement standart library containers from scratch: vector, and stack, using C++98 standart, including all their methods and functionality.  
Additional features are: iterators, reverse iterators, enable_if and some of the templates from type_traits header.

The namespace "ft" is used in the project and the functionality of the containers can be compared to the standard ones.
