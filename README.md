# ft_containers

The aim of the project is to reimplement standart library containers from scratch: vector, map, stack and set, using C++98 standart, including all their methods and functionality.  
Additional features are: iterators, reverse iterators, enable_if and some of the templates from type_traits header.

It is a work in progress: stack, vector and all of the additional functionality are done; map and set are on the way.
